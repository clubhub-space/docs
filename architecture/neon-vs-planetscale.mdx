[Neon](/stacks/neon) is truly serverless and its pricing is usage-based so we only pay for what we use.
You can have unlimited branches, and they support data branching out of the box.

[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) only offers unlimited branches and data branching in their Team plan which costs $599/mo.

The downside with using **Neon** instead of **PlanetScale** is that we have to deal with migrations ourselves using [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) instead of PlanetScale's [non-blocking schema changes](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes).
