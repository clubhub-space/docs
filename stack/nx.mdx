Nx is a development toolset and workspace generator designed to help developers manage monorepos and modular applications. Nx workspaces are organized into a single repository that contains multiple projects, with each project representing a specific application or library.

The Nx workspace provides a set of tools and best practices for building and managing these projects, including dependency management, build configuration, code sharing, and testing. With Nx, developers can easily share code between projects and enforce consistency across the codebase.

Nx also provides a set of powerful tools for code generation, testing, and analysis. These tools are integrated directly into the workspace, making it easy to run tests, lint code, and generate new code artifacts.

Overall, Nx workspaces provide a powerful and flexible way to manage large-scale projects and monorepos. They enable developers to build modular applications with reusable code and to leverage modern development practices such as testing, linting, and code sharing.
