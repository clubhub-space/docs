Prisma is a modern database toolkit that simplifies database access for application developers. It allows developers to model their application's data using a declarative schema language, which generates a type-safe client for querying the database. Prisma.io provides a powerful and intuitive API that enables developers to perform complex database operations with ease, including filtering, pagination, and aggregation.

With Prisma, developers can focus on building their applications without worrying about the complexities of database access. It provides a scalable and performant data layer that can be easily integrated with any application stack, allowing developers to build modern, data-driven applications with ease.
