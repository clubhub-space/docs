To be able to develop on the `space` [tagged](https://nx.dev/core-features/enforce-project-boundaries#tags) **Nx** projects, you'll first need a database to use with [Prisma](/development/prisma).<br/>
We'll be using [Neon branching](https://neon.tech/blog/frictionless-development-experience-with-neon-branching) to setup a clone of the production database that can be used for development.

### Prerequisites
- [Discord](/development/discord)
- [Git](/development/git)

### Create a Neon branch
Assuming you have the [clubhub](https://github.com/clubhub-space/clubhub) Git repository open.

Read the technical documentation [here](/applications/trigger-neon-branch).

1. Create a new Git branch
```bash
$ git checkout -b <name>
```
2. Push the Git branch
```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin <name>
```
3. Read the message posted in the `#neon` **Discord** channel that contains the next step. It'll look like the following below

4. You have now setup a [Neon branch](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/branching) for local development ðŸŽ‰.
