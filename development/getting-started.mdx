## Developing a feature example flow
1. Start by creating a new Git branch
```bash
$ git checkout -b feat/example
```

2. Now the next step you must do is push the newly created Git branch to the remote origin. This'll be explained why in the next step.
```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin feat/example
```

3. A PlanetScale database branch will now be created for you to use while developing your feature.
A message will be posted in the `#planetscale` Discord channel with the next step.
You can view the PlanetScale database branch [here](https://app.planetscale.com/clubhub/space/feat-example).
