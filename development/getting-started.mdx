## Developing a feature example flow
1. Start by creating a new Git branch
```bash
$ git checkout -b feat/example
```

2. Now the next step you must do is push the newly created Git branch to the remote origin. This'll be explained why in the next step.
```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin feat/example
```

3. A [Neon](/development/neon) database branch will now be created for you to use while developing your feature.
A message will be posted in the `#neon` Discord channel with the environment variables required for the [Space Database](/libraries/space-database).
View the full documentation [here](/applications/trigger-neon-branch).
